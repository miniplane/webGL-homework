1-9: toggle between the shapes

scaling:

    'x': decrease the width of the shape by a factor of 0.9
    'X': increase the width of the shape by a factor of 1.1
    'y': decrease the height of the shape by a factor of 0.9
    'Y': increase the height of the shape by a factor of 1.1
    'z': decrease the depth of the shape by a factor of 0.9
    'Z': increase the depth of the shape by a factor of 1.1

rotation:

    "w": rotate the current shape clockwise about the x-axis
    "s": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the x-axis
    "e": rotate the current shape clockwise about the y-axis 
    "q": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the y-axis
    "d": rotate the current shape clockwise about the z-axis
    "a": rotate the current shape counterclockwise about the z-axis
  
  movement:
  
		use arrow keys to move the selected shape
    "," (comma): move the shape forward
    "." (period): move the shape backward
